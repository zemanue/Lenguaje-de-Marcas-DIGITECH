        <h2>Educational Career</h2>
        <p>Graduated in Primary Education, I consider myself a passionate about education, always in continuous training. I have special interest in education through motor skills, active methodologies, neuroeducation, manipulative mathematics, etc.</p>
        <p>Since 2015, I have been a private tutor, helping children with different educational needs both in Primary Education and ESO, especially with Mathematics and Language. I have also taught Spanish to foreign children, and worked with special educational needs such as visual impairment, ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, language disorders, etc. </p>
        <p>Currently I have been able to expand my training with a Master in Advanced Teaching Skills and several courses on neuroscience, cooperative learning and manipulative mathematics.</p>
