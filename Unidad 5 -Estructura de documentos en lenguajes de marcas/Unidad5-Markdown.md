# 👋 Hi, I’m @zemanue

At the moment, I’m focused on learning everything I can about programming, making code as clear as possible with comments in Spanish (teacher issues, I guess…).

## Educational Career
Graduated in Primary Education, I consider myself a passionate about education, always in continuous training. I have special interest in education through motor skills, active methodologies, neuroeducation, manipulative mathematics, etc.

**Since 2015**, I have been a **private tutor**, helping children with different educational needs both in ***Primary Education and ESO***, especially with ***Mathematics and Language***. I have also taught Spanish to foreign children, and worked with special educational needs such as visual impairment, ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, language disorders, etc.

Currently I have been able to expand my training with a Master in Advanced Teaching Skills and several courses on neuroscience, cooperative learning and manipulative mathematics.
